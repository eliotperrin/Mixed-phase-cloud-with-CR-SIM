Contain all the code of my bachelor's thesis

In order to be able to analyze the different netcdf files, we used the jupyter notebook, which is a file in which we can execute Python code and write com- ments in markdowns. The version of Python that was used is version 3.10.9 in a Conda environment with which various libraries were installed.

Some parts of the code are adapted from code provided by Paraskevi Georgakaki and Anne-Claire Billault-Roux
